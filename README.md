# BridgeExamples

This repository contains examples of how to use the [Bridge library](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/YunBridgeLibrary) on the [Arduino Yún](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardYun). 
Some of the examples were written to connect the Yún to other servers, or to [node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) scripts.
Where appropriate, the node.js scripts are included.

Any client-side JavaScript in these examples uses [p5.js](http://www.p5js.org) for DOM manipulation and for connection 
from the client back to the Yún.
