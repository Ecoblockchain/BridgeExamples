# BridgeExamples

This repository contains examples of how to use the Bridge library on the Arduino Yún. 
Some of the examples were written to connect the Yún to other servers, or to [node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) scripts.
Where appropriate, the node.js scripts are included.

Any client-side JavaScript in these examples uses [p5.js](http://www.p5js.org) for DOM manipulation and for connection 
from the client back to the Yún.
